# dtu - detect the undetected
Web-based tool for epidemic outbreak development monitoring & prediction

## 1 Use case description (qwertzuiop)
(use cases go here)
How can the number of undetected infection or infections with mild symptoms be reduced or better estimated?

No symptoms 
Providing an app, where detected people make an account and are a knot in the network. They invite every person they had contact with to the app. This people are then children of the inviter and also the negative cases can invite people they had contact with if they want. Ideally separate trees start to connect. People could log-in without being related to a positive case and allowing the app to use their google maps data to compare it with location data of positive cases, it they allowed this feature. Location data could also get entered manually, and data points manually removed when someone want to hide some information. A value gets calculated and when it’s high, people get suggested to get tested.

Mild symptoms

· Random tests. Focusing on people that still commute. More tests in positive-covid dense areas and in general dense places. 
· People that work in take-aways, food deliveries should get tested, because they are a potential hotspot for spread. 
· Ordered stuff should get washed, disinfected, treated as potentially contaminated 

-

· Supervision in Supermarkets, trains, Airports… Testing Body Temperature with Devices that allow the contact less measurement. Supervisors being alert of people coughing 
· When detecting a potential case: Asking them to give a sample. Supervisors to get taught how to behave with people without triggering them, making them feel bad.

Putting money and collecting engineers and experts to develop a cheap test for testing in huge quantities!

Getting tested with symptoms at home

Positive test result

Testing the rest of the members living in the house

· Cleaning shared facilities in the neighborhood/apartment building
· Asking the victim to provide data, maybe getting therapists that help them to remember what they did the last weeks or developing a video/brochure how to.
· Give a guideline how to treat themselves and how the members to behave. Providing help when the community has no friends or family to provide them with necessities.
· Positive cases to get preferred in LeShop,Coop@Home,…
· Teaching them a tool how to keep track like asking themselves: Did this symptom got better or worse. When the symptoms get worse, obliging them to get help! When the symptoms seem to get vanished, contact in, waiting again maybe two weeks and then making a new test and testing for antibodies and stuff.
· Giving positive cases that got treated the chance to share their experience in a
forum. What helped them, what was bad,…

Negative test result

Asking them to still stay at home till they get well and recommending them to test every day in the next 3 days (maybe the test will get positive)
